    Leonardo, nicknamed Leo, is a fictional superhero and one of the four main characters in the Teenage Mutant Ninja
    Turtles comics and related media.

    He is often depicted wearing a blue bandanna. His signature weapons are two Ninjatos, commonly confused as Katanas.
    Leonardo is the eldest brother and the leader of the group. He is the most skilled, the most serious, the most
    spiritual, the most mature, the most disciplined and the most in-line with Splinter's teachings and thoughts. Like
    all of the brothers, he is named after an Italian Renaissance artist, in this case Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo da
    Vinci is widely considered the most diversely skilled individual of the Renaissance period, and as such Leonardo is
    also considered the most diversely skilled ninja turtle. In the Mirage comics, all four of the Turtles wear red
    masks, but for the creators to tell them apart, he was written and redrawn to have an ocean-blue mask.
